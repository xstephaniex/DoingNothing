# DoingNothing_Connectionless
This project was part of the ICOM4036 (Structures & Properties of Programming Languages) and consists on the design and implementation of an Educational Programming Language.

## Indroduction
Learning how to like networking may be a difficult task, especially for ICOM/Software/CIIC students who like programming. This is in part because students have the idea that networking doesn't require designing, developing and programming. Other important aspect to consider is that it is difficult to find certifications, classes, and laboratories that adjusts to different learning styles.

Educators are implementing more novel, simplified and interactive teaching techniques into their curriculums. This is with the purpose to engage and motivate students to learn. These initiatives, especially simplifying has shown effectiveness in motivating students to learn. 
With this in mind, it is proposed the creation and implementation of doingNothing_Connectionless, as a programming language for people to have a better idea of what networking is. The main goals for such programming language are the following:
Implement simple and intuitive syntax.
  -Simplify learning programming.
  -Develop problem solving skills.

## Language features
### Educational
The programming language was designed to facilitate people in understanding how a simple network communication is achieved.

It does this by facilitating the design of a client/server communication, it provides an intuitive syntax for the developer to create a server/client, all in a single platform.

### Simple and Easy to Learn Syntax 
The language is designed with an intuitive and simple syntax. The main purpose of the programming language is to encourage people to learn and hav a better understanding of how communication between devices work. 
 
### Imperative and Object Oriented 
The programming language follows an imperative style of programming. Each expression is executed once in the programming language.

The programming language several predefined functions that allow the user to connect, create, request, send message between a Client and a server. 

Data Types in the programming language are interpreted. Also it is a declarative language. 

Data Types in the programming language are interpreted.
### Free and Open Source
 DoingNothing_Connectionless will be free and open source such that students or developers can play with the language and add other features to it.
## Future Work 
-Connect multiple clients to multiple servers (In other words developing multiple communication). 
-Make a client have multiple open sockets to request many operations to the server. 
-Do an external server, and make the user pick between connecting to a local server or external server.
## Implementation and Requirement tools
### Python 3.6 - 
To be used as intermediate code.
### PLY (Python Lex and Yacc)- 
To develop language and interpreter components like the scanner and parser for our programming language.
### Socket 
To develop the client and server communication.
